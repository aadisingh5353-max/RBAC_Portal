# RBAC – Role-Based Access Control System
A Node.js + Express backend application that manages secure user authentication, role-based authorization, and protected routes using MongoDB, JWT, and Bcrypt.

This system assigns roles like **Admin**, **Manager**, and **User**, and ensures that every API endpoint is accessible only to allowed roles.
